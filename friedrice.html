        <h2>COOKING-STEPS</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Rinse the rice with cold water, pour it into a large pot.</strong><br> 
            Place 1 cup(178g) of dry rice into a fine mesh strainer. Run cold water 
            over the rice and use your clean hands to gently rinse the rice.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add two (2) cups of water to the large pot.</strong><br> 
            When parboiling, use twice as much water as you do rice. In this case, 
            use 2 cups (473ml) of water since you are parboiling 1 cup (178g) of dry 
            rice. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Boil the mixture over high heat for five minutes.</strong><br> 
            Bring the water to a full rolling boil. Then start your timer 
            and let the rice boiled for five minutes. Keep the lid off the 
            pot while the liquid heats up, so it doesn't boil over. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Transfer the rice to a fine mesh strainer.</strong><br> 
            Turn off the beat and hold a fine mesh strainer over your 
            sink. Pour the mixture into the strainer to drain the water 
            from the rice.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rinse off the rice with cold water.</strong><br> 
            Take the strainer out of the bowl of water, and rinse off the rice again 
            with cold water from the faucet. At this point, your rice is parboiled 
            and ready to use in this recipe. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Put 1/2 cup (118ml) of stock in a large pot and bring it to a boil.</strong><br> 
            Nigerian Fried Rice is traditionally made with Chicken or turkey stock. Add 
            1/2 cup (118ml) of the stock to a large pot or saucepan. Let the liqiud come 
            to a full rolling boil.
            <ul>
                <li>In traditional Nigerian recipe, rice is always cooked on meat stock 
                    (unlike the rice in Chinese Fried rice, Which is cooked in plain water.)
                </li>
                <li>If you prefer, use beef or vegetable stock instead.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add the parboiled rice and boil the mixture for 25 minutes.</strong><br> 
            Carefully put the parboiled rice into the boiling stock. Boil the rice 
            until it absorbs all of the stock, which usually takes around 25 minutes.
